# Anime Recommendation System: Hybrid Approach with Flask and hnswlib

## Overview

This application is a **hybrid anime recommendation system** combining **collaborative filtering (user-user)** with **content-based recommendations**. It uses **hnswlib** for fast approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search, a **Flask backend** for API handling, and a **SQLAlchemy database** for data storage.

---

## Features

- **User-User Collaborative Filtering**:
  - Finds similar users based on anime ratings.
  - Recommends anime liked by similar users.
- **Content-Based Recommendations**:
  - Suggests anime with similar genres to a user's favorites.
- **Autocomplete API**:
  - Provides anime name suggestions for user input.
- **Optimized Performance**:
  - Sparse matrix representation for memory efficiency.
  - hnswlib ANN indexing for fast nearest neighbor search.
- **Scalable Architecture**:
  - Handles thousands of users and anime with efficient memory usage.

---

## System Workflow

### 1. **Initialization**

1. **Load Environment Variables**:

   - Load `DATABASE_URL` and `SECRET_KEY` from `.env`.
   - Throw errors if not set.

2. **Database Connection**:

   - Establish a SQLAlchemy connection pool.
   - Verify connection liveness with `pool_pre_ping`.

3. **Load Anime Data**:

   - Fetch `anime_id` and `name` into `anime_df` for fuzzy matching and mapping.

4. **Build hnswlib Index**:
   - Check for existing index and mappings on disk.
   - If unavailable, build the user-anime interaction matrix and create a new index.

---

### 2. **Data Preparation**

#### Sparse User-Anime Matrix

- **Fetch Ratings**:
  - Load user ratings (`user_id`, `anime_id`, `rating`) from the database.
  - Replace `-1` with `0` to indicate no rating.
- **Map IDs to Indices**:
  - Assign users to rows and anime to columns.
- **Construct Matrix**:
  - Create a **Compressed Sparse Row (CSR)** matrix, optimizing memory usage for large datasets.

---

### 3. **Recommendation Algorithms**

#### **Collaborative Filtering (User-User)**

1. **Find Similar Users**:

   - Use hnswlib to query the **k nearest neighbors** (similar users).

2. **Aggregate Recommendations**:

   - Collect anime highly rated by neighbors but not watched by the user.
   - Rank recommendations by rating count and score.

3. **Insert New Users**:
   - If a user is not in the index:
     - Build their vector based on their anime list.
     - Add it to the index and update the database.

#### **Content-Based Recommendations**

1. **TF-IDF Vectorization**:

   - Represent anime genres using **TF-IDF scores**.
   - Convert genres into a weighted bag-of-words format.

2. **Calculate Similarity**:

   - Use **cosine similarity** to find anime similar to the user's favorites.

3. **Generate Recommendations**:
   - Rank and return the top recommendations, excluding anime the user already liked.

---

### 4. **Endpoints**

#### `/users/recommendations` [POST]

- Accepts a `user_id` and `anime_list`.
- Supports two algorithms:
  - `user-user` (default)
  - `content-based`

#### `/api/anime-suggestions` [GET]

- Returns anime name suggestions based on a query string.

## Key Technologies

- **hnswlib**:

  - Fast ANN search for user similarity.
  - Space-efficient graph-based indexing.

- **Flask**:

  - Lightweight backend for API handling.
  - Supports CORS for cross-origin requests.

- **SQLAlchemy**:

  - Efficient ORM for database interactions.
  - Connection pooling for scalability.

- **scipy.sparse**:
  - Memory-efficient representation of sparse matrices.
- **TF-IDF**:
  - Transform anime genres into numerical vectors for similarity calculations.

---

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Sparse Matrix Representation**:

   - Saves memory by storing only non-zero ratings.

2. **hnswlib Indexing**:

   - Provides O(log N) query time for nearest neighbor searches.

3. **Profiling Tools**:
   - `@timeit_decorator`: Measures function execution time.
   - `@memory_profiler_decorator`: Tracks memory usage.

---

## Execution Flow

### **Startup**

1. Load environment variables.
2. Establish a database connection.
3. Fetch anime data into memory.
4. Build or load the hnswlib index.

### **User-User Recommendations**

1. Accept `user_id` and `anime_list` via API.
2. Insert the user into the hnswlib index if new.
3. Query the index for similar users.
4. Aggregate and rank recommendations.

### **Content-Based Recommendations**

1. Accept `anime_list` via API.
2. Compute cosine similarity between userâ€™s liked anime and all anime.
3. Rank and return top results.

### **Autocomplete**

1. Accept a query string via API.
2. Fetch matching anime names from the database.
